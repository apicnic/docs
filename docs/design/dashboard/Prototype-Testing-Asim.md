# Observations:

(wireframe1)
**Question 1:what do you think about the design?**

- User assumes he can manually configure overview information that would be appearing for each APIs. 
(e.g. selecting No. of calls, Avg. response time, unique users, etc. for 1 API; selecting only the 1st 2 briefs for another, etc.)

**Question 2: Where you can configure which cards to appear in dashboard**

- user is looking for a configuration button somewhere in the API name dropdown.
- User wishes to look for threshold values to compare against a specific metric (especially for avg. response time).
- User expects if any of the metric values exceeds some predefined threshold, there should be visual cue to indicate it.
(alternatives: alert, email, audible alert, etc.). If everything is monochromic color, he might lost the things that needs his attention. 
Visual alert is more effective.
- The user needs a dashboard not only to see brief information but also to get alerts and be alerted.

**Question 3: what about the information about percentage increase/decrease in value of the metrics defined.
- That would depend on the threshold set. If user clicks a specific metric card, then he expects to see a dialogue showing him that metric in a time graph.
- the indications are good. it can be use case for other API owners, but not for him. 
the indications should be color coded to notify whch is a positive change and which is not. 
That should differe based on the type of metric user is viewing.

**Question 3: what is your preference period of time to see the data in the dashboard?**
- For the participant, it is more relevant to show data is updated in 5 minutes or less. (as real time or possible)
- For monitoring purpose, real time data is more important.
- agrregrated information (monthly/weekly) is more appropriate for "good to know" purposes.Its better for presentation

**Question 4: what is your idea about data refreshin?**
- Refreshing and the repopulation of data should be information not older than 2 minute.
for weekly purpose: from now until the same time in past week.

** Question 5: what do you think happens when you touch a card here?**
- on clicking a card, it gives me a detailed overview
(we switched into the second wireframe)
- a new dialogue, not a new page. Because page would loose all the context for the user
- a dialogue makes more sense, because user stays in the same context and 
there is no need to repopulate all the data that needs to be done when navigating to a new page.
This reduces redundant development and system calls to fetch the data

**Question 6: what about the detailed overview shown there?**
