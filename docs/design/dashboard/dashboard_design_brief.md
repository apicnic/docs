# APInf Information Dashboard design brief
This document is meant serve as a **common basis for understanding** the scope and purpose of the **APInf Information Dashboard**.

## Intent
The **APInf Information Dashboard** is intended to help **APInf stakeholders** (end-users) gain an **awareness/understanding of their current situation** at any given point in time through the use of **data visualisation**.

## Key concepts
In order to agree on what to build, it is important to define basic terminology. That way, our conversation can share a common vocabulary. Shared definitions of key concepts will also give our team a basis to evaluate any proposed designs/solutions.

### Information Dashboard
> A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.
>
> -- Stephen Few "Dashboard Confusion." *Intelligent Enterprise*

---

> Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (key performance indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process
>
> -- Wikipedia contributors. ["Dashboard (business)."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)) Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 4 Apr. 2017. Web.

The APInf Dashboard Design Working Group came up with the following concepts we believe define the concept of a Dashboard:

- one view
  - at-a-glance understanding with no/minimal scrolling
- show the big picture
  - overview
- synthesis
- allow user to get to deeper levels (of data/understanding)
- enhance contextual awareness
- show things that need immediate attention
  - suggest appropriate action

### Situation awareness
> [Situation awareness] is informed by a particular set of facts that add up to an overview of the situation. People want those facts to be readily avaiilable, displayed in a way that makes them easy and efficient to percieve, understand, and if necessary, respond. That display is a dashboard.

## Principles
> Rules are for practitioners who donâ€™t really know the value of this process, while principles demand wisdom and maturity.

Several core principles can guide the design process.

### Three Principles of Good Visualization Design
> Good data visualization is
> - trustworthy
> - accessible
> - elegant
>
> -- Kirk, A. (2016). Data visualisation: a handbook for data driven design. Los Angeles: Sage Publications.

## Circumstances
> Defining your project's circumstances involves identifying all the requirements and restrictions that are inherited by you, imposed *on* you or determined *by* you.
>
> -- Kirk, A. (2016). Data visualisation: a handbook for data driven design. Los Angeles: Sage Publications.

### People

* Who are the project's primary stakeholders?
* What levels of expertise might our users have?
* What information might our stakeholders need to access?
* How might users be able to adjust the dashboard to meet their individual needs?

We explored the above questions during a workshop (on 12.06.2017), and came up with the following personas/needs:

![APInf user personas and information needs](https://cdn.rawgit.com/apinf/docs/master/docs/design/dashboard/APInfInformationDashboard-stakeholderNeeds.png)

Additional notes from in-house discussions:

- API/Organization owner needs to see
    - errors/problems at a glance (particularly red error flags)
    - problems are on top of list
    - access details view on demand

### Constraints

* What are some limitations of this project?
* What are the time constraints?

After a brief, and slightly difficult, discussion, we came up with the following constraints:

- we are a **small team**
- we are dependent on existing solutions
  - e.g. data sources/structure not always determined by us
- we have a short time to complete this project (aprox. 1 month)
  - one sprint for basic design/implementation
  - one sprint for testing and user feedback 

### Consumption

- How will people access this project?
- What (basic) screen sizes, and other media will they use to perceive the visualizations?

### Deliverables

- What types of output, or deliverables, will we produce during the design/development process? E.g.
  - dashboard project design brief
  - new/improved proto-personas
  - user journey/storyboards
  - wireframes/paper prototypes
    - user feedback (interviews, survey results)
  - HTML mock-ups
  - prototype web application
    - usability tests (notes from user observation sessions, interviews)
    - Notes from [1st](https://github.com/apinf/docs/blob/master/docs/design/dashboard/Prototype-Testing-Asim.md) user interview
    - Notes from [2nd](https://github.com/apinf/docs/blob/master/docs/design/dashboard/Prototype-Testing-Jarkko.md) user interview.
    - Notes from [3rd](https://github.com/apinf/docs/blob/master/docs/design/dashboard/Prototype-Testing-Vesa.md) user interview.
  - improvements to/revitalization of dashboard implementation

### Resources

- What types of skills do we have available as a team?
- How much time does each member of the team have to commit to the completion of this project?

## Purpose
> When setting out to design a dashboard, we must, before anything else, clearly define the dashboard's purpose.

### Discussion questions
- Why are we building this dashboard/data visualisation?
- What are we trying to accomplish with this dashboard?
- What does a successful outcome of using the dashboard look like?

## Goals

Based on user interviews (in-house employes chosen to represent customer roles), we have identified several user goals. 

### High-level goals
At a high level, at least the following categories of understanding are important:

- errors and trouble
    - performance (latency, traffic, etc.)
    - errors
    - stability (rapid changes, patterns, outages, etc.)
    - broken user management (authentication)
 - patterns and trends over time
 - compare historic values
   - spikes, dips, limits, special cases (outliers), common values (mean/median)

### Important details
Several specific details would be useful to see:

- which API needs immediate attention
  - problematic APIs appearing on top of the list
  - see a quick number of APIs that need immediate action before seeing the overview
  - downtime (current and past)
- number of calls
  - the number of failed calls
  - see failed/error/slow calls
- average response time
- unique users (possibly by API key)
  - unique user may be needed for a specific API only
  - some APIs may not have need for unique users
- the **correlation** between response time and failed calls
- details about slow/failed/error calls and their time for a parcitular API
- details such as HTTPS handshake durations, DNS lookup duration, etc. might be needed
- how happy the customers are
  - i.e. average rating? number of feedback reports?
- how popular API grows among users
  - number of unique users
  - number of bookmarks (see who follows API)?
  - number of visits to API Profile?

### Useful capabilities
The following abilities might be useful to one or more of our hypothetical user roles:

- filter the APIs displayed
- use the url to show developers where the problem is
- automatic refresh of chart data (i.e. real-time dashboard)
  - show data that is updated in 5 minutes or less (as real time or possible)
  - real time data is more important for monitoring information (e.g. errors and alerts)
- historic data (e.g. daily, weekly, or monthly aggregations) for showing trends, changes, spikes, etc. over time
  - weekly aggregations: from now until the same time in previous week
  - montly aggregations: from now until same time one month ago (30 days?)
- indications about things that need attention
- try not to overcrowd the display
- colors are useful to indicate status of an API (for users who can differentiate red from green)
  - indications should be color coded to notify whch is a positive (interpreted as 'good') change and which is not
- manually configure overview information that would be appearing for each API
  - e.g. number of calls, avg. response time, unique users, etc.
- set threshold values to [filter] a specific metric (especially for avg. response time)
- visual indicator if any of the metric values exceeds some predefined threshold
- numbers should be the main thing to get focus (1st glance)
- try to keep user in one context (i.e. no navigation, or change in view)
  - helps user stay 'oriented'
  - no need to fetch and repopulate all the data
- see metrics for individual endpoints (not just at the 'API' level of aggregation)
- ability to select specific timeframe
  - e.g. specific week, month, year from historic data
  - possibly a date picker with start and end dates
- responsive user interface
- consider complexity of choosing metaphorically correct icons
  - prefer text descriptions
  - icons may be confusing
- get all possible data for an API
- might want to **predict** the next (abnormal) rise/fall of any metrics
    
## Vision
> What you need to consider here is what can you envision being the most suitable type(s) of visualisation that might be most capable of accomplishing what you intend.

### Discussion questions

- What will it look like for someone to use this information dashboard?
- How will it improve their work, life, etc.?
- What would be a basic narrative of one or more people as they interact with the dashboard?
- How can we design the dashboard to help people achieve their desired goals and outcomes?
