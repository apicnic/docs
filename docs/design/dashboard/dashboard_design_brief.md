# APInf Dashboard design brief
This document is meant serve as a **common basis for understanding** the scope and purpose of the APInf Dashboard component.

## First principles
In order to agree on what to build, it is important to define basic terminology. That way, our conversation can share a common vocabulary.

### Dashboard
> A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.
>
> -- Stephen Few "Dashboard Confusion." *Intelligent Enterprise*.

> Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (key performance indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process
>
> -- Wikipedia contributors. ["Dashboard (business)."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)) Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 4 Apr. 2017. Web.

> All dashboards should display a quantitative analysis of what is going on with immediacy and intuitiveness.

### Situation awareness
> [Situation awareness] is informed by a particular set of facts that add up to an overview of the situation. People want those facts to be readily avaiilable, displayed in a way that makes them easy and efficient to percieve, understand, and if necessary, respond. That display is a dashboard.
