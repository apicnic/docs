# APInf Dashboard design brief
This document is meant serve as a **common basis for understanding** the scope and purpose of the APInf Dashboard component.

## Key concepts
In order to agree on what to build, it is important to define basic terminology. That way, our conversation can share a common vocabulary.

### Dashboard
> A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.
>
> -- Stephen Few "Dashboard Confusion." *Intelligent Enterprise*.

> Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (key performance indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process
>
> -- Wikipedia contributors. ["Dashboard (business)."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)) Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia. Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, 4 Apr. 2017. Web.

> All dashboards should display a quantitative analysis of what is going on with immediacy and intuitiveness.

### Data visualisation
> [Data visualisation is] the representation and presentation of data in order to facilitate understanding
>
> -- Kirk, A. (2016). Data visualisation: a handbook for data driven design. Los Angeles: Sage Publications.

### Situation awareness
> [Situation awareness] is informed by a particular set of facts that add up to an overview of the situation. People want those facts to be readily avaiilable, displayed in a way that makes them easy and efficient to percieve, understand, and if necessary, respond. That display is a dashboard.

## Principles
Several core principles can guide the design process.

### Three Principles of Good Visualization Design
> Good data visualization is
> - trustworthy
> - accessible
> - elegant
>

## Purpose
> When setting out to design a dashboard, we must, before anything else, clearly define the dashboard's purpose.

### Discussion questions
- Why are we building this dashboard/data visualisation?
- What are we trying to accomplish with this dashboard?
- What does a successful outcome of using the dashboard look like?

## Goals
> to design an effetive dashbard, we must get into the clients' minds and examine the mental models for the activities that the dashboard will help them monitor.
>
> -- Few, S. (2013). *Information dashboard design: displaying data for at-a-glance monitoring.* Burlingame, CA: Analytics Press.

> A worthwhile data visualization project should commence from a starting point of curiosity, [since the goal of] data visualisation is to facilitate understanding.
>
> -- Kirk, A. (2016). Data visualisation: a handbook for data driven design. Los Angeles: Sage Publications.

### Discussion questions
- What types of understanding to we want to help facilitate?

## Circumstances
> Defining your project's circumstances involves identifying all the requirements and restrictions that are inherited by you, imposed *on* you or determined *by* you.
