# APInf Information Dashboard design brief
This document is meant serve as a **common basis for understanding** the scope and purpose of the **APInf Information Dashboard**.

## Intent
The **APInf Information Dashboard** is intended to help **APInf stakeholders** (end-users) gain an **awareness/understanding of their current situation** at any given point in time through the use of **data visualisation**.

## Key concepts
In order to agree on what to build, it is important to define basic terminology. That way, our conversation can share a common vocabulary. Shared definitions of key concepts will also give our team a basis to evaluate any proposed designs/solutions.

### Information Dashboard
> A dashboard is a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance.
>
> -- Stephen Few "Dashboard Confusion." *Intelligent Enterprise*

---

> Dashboards often provide at-a-glance views of KPIs (key performance indicators) relevant to a particular objective or business process

> All dashboards should display a quantitative analysis of what is going on with immediacy and intuitiveness.

### Data visualisation
> [Data visualisation is] the representation and presentation of data in order to facilitate understanding

### Situation awareness
> [Situation awareness] is informed by a particular set of facts that add up to an overview of the situation. People want those facts to be readily avaiilable, displayed in a way that makes them easy and efficient to percieve, understand, and if necessary, respond. That display is a dashboard.

## Principles
Several core principles can guide the design process.

### Three Principles of Good Visualization Design
> Good data visualization is
> - trustworthy
> - accessible
> - elegant

## Circumstances
> Defining your project's circumstances involves identifying all the requirements and restrictions that are inherited by you, imposed *on* you or determined *by* you.

### People

* Who are the project's primary stakeholders?

### Constraints

* What are some limitations of this project?
* What are the time constraints?

### Consumption

- How will people access this project?
- What (basic) screen sizes, and other media will they use to percieve the visualizations?

### Deliverables

- What types of output, or deliverables, will we produce during the design/development process? E.g.
  - dashboard project design brief
  - new/improved proto-personas
  - user journey/storyboards
  - wireframes/paper prototypes
    - user feedback (interviews, survey results)
  - HTML mock-ups
  - prototype web application
    - usability tests (notes from user observation sessions, interviews)
  - improvements to/revitalization of dashboard implementation

### Resources

- What types of skills do we have available as a team?
- How much time does each member of the team have to commit to the completion of this project?

## Purpose
> When setting out to design a dashboard, we must, before anything else, clearly define the dashboard's purpose.
>

### Discussion questions
- Why are we building this dashboard/data visualisation?
- What are we trying to accomplish with this dashboard?
- What does a successful outcome of using the dashboard look like?

## Goals
> the user and their goals often become lost in the lengthy debates over features, designs, and implementations. Empathy is at the heart of great products and services.

> to design an effetive dashbard, we must get into the clients' minds and examine the mental models for the activities that the dashboard will help them monitor.

> A worthwhile data visualization project should commence from a starting point of curiosity, [since the goal of] data visualisation is to facilitate understanding.

### Discussion questions
- What types of understanding to we want to help facilitate?

## Vision
> What you need to consider here is what can you envision being the most suitable type(s) of visualisation that might be most capable of accomplishing what you intend.

### Discussion questions

- What will it look like for someone to use this information dashboard?
- How will it improve their work, life, etc.?
- What would be a basic narrative of one or more people as they interact with the dashboard?
- How can we design the dashboard to help people achieve their desired goals and outcomes?
