# Takeaways from the FIWARE Summit (Utrecht, Amsterdam - 2017)

## Integration
The current progress towards integrating APInf and FIWARE includes:
- Monetization via FIWARE Business Ecosystem
- Analytics from API Umbrella
- Analytics dashboard with FIWARE WireCloud
- API Management from APInf
- Data Catalogue with CKAN
- Payments via Paypal


The above components have been shown to work together. However, the user experience is somewhat fragmented, since the each component has it's own user interface.
