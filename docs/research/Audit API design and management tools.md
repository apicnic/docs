*   Is the product a proxy, agent or a hybrid? What can you find about the technology behind the manager?
**   **Lifecycle management**
*   Is the tool only a manager or does it have features that cater for other parts of API lifecycle. How does it work? What other features does it have? 

*   **Programming languages / technologies**
*   Which programming language(s) / technologies  does the product base on? 
**   **UI**
*   If possible provide a screenshot of the UI and some additional information about usability and design.
**   **Strengths**
