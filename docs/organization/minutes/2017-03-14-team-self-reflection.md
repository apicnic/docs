## Team communication

### Problems
* remote teams
* "too much" communication, especially on RocketChat
* RocketChat difficult to follow
* Channel purposes unclear, too many channels to follow
* a lot of discussions, but not necessarily actionable conclusions
* How to involve and include remote team members: online, real-time discussions
* Onboarding process
* Knowledge management
* Ground rule for discussion, particularly agreement
* Not knowing the team members

### Solutions and actions
* more live discussions
* short monthly meeting with everyone (AP Taija)
* Internal "Facebook", should be kept private (AP Brylie, Philippe, Vesa)
* Monday (?) bun (AP Taija)
* Should there be a discussion forum for longer / long-term discussions, while chat would be for immediate needs (AP Brylie)
* Skype welcome meeting for newcomers
* Chilling area in "Mexico", bean bags, should also have screen AP Taija)
* Code of conduct review (AP Brylie)
* Welcome/survival guide for newcomers (should be printable pdf)
* Rocket chat gardening
  * Make sure channels have descriptions (AP channel owners)
  * removing and possibly adding channels: each channel should have a clear purpose
  
  
## Customer feedback loop

### Problems
* How does the dev team get feedback from customers?
* What is the needs discovery process and prioritization?

* pipeline visibility, CRM
