# Sprint 39 Sprint Review Meeting

Date and time: 2017-03-31 13:00-14:00 (EET)

Participants: Illya, Brylie, Jawid, Matti, Taija


## Brylie

### API administrator handbook

Brylie presented the handbook content structure, which looked fine. Content can be fetched from Readme.md's etc.
Handbook was written with GitBook Editor, which is WYSIWYG-editor and can produce different file types. Brylie found editor to be usable.

### New architecture

Discussions about tools to be used: Python recommended. Brylie presented OpenAPI designer tool. 
Aurelia (scaffold present) seems to be good one, too. It generates much automatically, produces pure Javascript, which is considered to be useful for future.
