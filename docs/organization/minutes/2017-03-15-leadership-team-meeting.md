# Discussion
We need to plan a weekly leadership team meeting.
  
There are a lot of new internal teams.
  - how do we schedule meetings?
  - how do we avoid spending too much time in meetings?
  - it is also important to realize that meetings serve a purpose
    - foster communication, understanding, decision making, inclusion
    - how do we strike the balance?
  - team leaders can decide own leadership style
  - overall company guidelines will be defined for reasonable leadership practices
  - team leaders can be responsible for team building
  - team members can open up more
    - be accepting of peoples' differences
      - personality
      - emotions
      - language
      - etc.
