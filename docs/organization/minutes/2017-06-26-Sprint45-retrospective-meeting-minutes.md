# Sprint 45 Review Meeting
* 22.06.2017 13:15 - 14:00
* Participants: Brylie, Kerkko, Matti, Taija, Tulir

# Conclusions
We will try **one week sprints**. Each sprint will have proportional:
- planning meeting
- debriefing
  - review output
  - mini retrospective
  
We will continue with dailies. We will see how relevant the dailies are, since we are a small team with diverse tasks. Dailies should be no more than around ten minutes.

We will continue using Kanban (Waffle.io with Github issues).
